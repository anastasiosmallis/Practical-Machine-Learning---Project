In this project, our goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict whether they performed barbell lifts correctly or incorrectly.

For more information on the data and the goal of its collection please refer to [Velloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H.](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#ixzz3ysiRm5VJ)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Downloading the data
train<-read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv",header = TRUE, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
test<-read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv", header = TRUE, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))

# Viewing the different possible outcomes
levels(train$classe)
```
Above we can see the possible different outcomes.

Below is the code in which I will do an initial testing on how well we can predict using the following methods: 
1. Random Forest
2. Generalized Boosted Regression Modeling
3. Linear Discriminant Analysis
4. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator

I will only perform the analysis on the relevant variables.
Last but not least I will perform a 2-fold Cross Validation on the training set.
This willmake the accuracy close to the out of sample accuracy.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(gbm)
library(plyr)
library(elasticnet)
library(MASS)

# Only keep relevant variables
modeltrain <- train[ , colSums(is.na(train)) == 0]
modeltrain <- modeltrain[,-c(1:6)]

# Cross Validation
fitControl <- trainControl(## 2-fold CV
                           method = "repeatedcv",
                           number = 2,
                           ## repeated ten times
                           repeats = 2)

# 1. Random Forest
# train
fit_rf<- train(classe~., data=modeltrain,
                trControl = fitControl,
                method = "rf")
# predict
prf<-predict(fit_rf)
# accuracy calculation
acc_rf<-confusionMatrix(prf,train$classe)$overall['Accuracy']

# 2. Generalized Boosted Regression Modeling
# train
fit_gbm<- train(classe~., data=modeltrain,
                trControl = fitControl,
                method = "gbm")
# predict
pgbm<-predict(fit_gbm)
# accuracy calculation
acc_gbm<-confusionMatrix(pgbm,train$classe)$overall['Accuracy']

# 3. Linear Discriminant Analysis
# train
fit_lda<- train(classe~., data=modeltrain,
                trControl = fitControl,
                method = "lda")
# predict
plda<-predict(fit_lda)
# accuracy calculation
acc_lda<-confusionMatrix(plda,train$classe)$overall['Accuracy']

# 4. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator
# train
fit_lasso<- train(classe~., data=modeltrain,
                trControl = fitControl,
                method = "lasso")
# predict
plasso<-predict(fit_lasso)
# accuracy calculation
acc_lasso<-confusionMatrix(plasso,train$classe)$overall['Accuracy']

```
See bellow the out-of-sample accuracy of the four models.
1. Random Forest: .99.
2. Generalized Boosted Regression Modeling: .98.
3. Linear Discriminant Analysis: .97.
4. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator: .98.

Now I am going to combine all the methods to find if the combination has better accuracy and if this is they case use that as my predictor.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
combined<-data.frame(prf, pgbm, plda, plasso, train$classe)
fit<- train(classe~., data= combined)
acc<-confusionMatrix(fit,train$classe)$overall['Accuracy']
```
The combined method's accurancy is .99.
